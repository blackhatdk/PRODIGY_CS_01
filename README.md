# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher used in cryptography, named after Julius Caesar who is believed to have used it to communicate with his generals. It operates by shifting each letter in the plaintext a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. For instance, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be encrypted as 'D', 'B' as 'E', and so forth. The Caesar Cipher is a simple and easy-to-understand encryption method, but it is also very basic and vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to its limited number of possible keys (shift values). Despite its weaknesses, the Caesar Cipher serves as a fundamental concept in cryptography and provides a starting point for understanding more advanced encryption techniques.
